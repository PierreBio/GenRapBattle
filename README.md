## Documentation

1. Once the project is downloaded, you can launch it with Unity and then go onto the scene : "BattleScene".
2. Here, you can start the scene but **be aware that it will launch a python server automatically in a parallel process and install packages to handle text generation model. It can be heavy for your computer.**
3. Once all the packages are installed, you can generate sentences by pressing "space" button.
